1.	Background & Design Flexibility

o	Please implement a clean, modern background (e.g., gradient or image-based)
o	We’d like to be able to easily change or update background images ourselves later — ideally via a variable or config setting


2.	Language Switcher (UI only)

o	Add a language dropdown or buttons in the top-right corner of the website
o	Options: German, French, Italian, English
o	For now, this does not need to actually translate the website — just simulate the switcher (we’ll implement translation later)

Homepage Modifications (Updated):
1.	Modern background design
o	Replace the current background with a more modern, slightly dark background (gradient or image-based is fine)
o	Please make the background easily editable (e.g., in a config or assets folder)

2.	Remove “Made in Switzerland”

o	Please delete this text from the homepage 

3.	Add an “About Us” section

o	Below the “Games on the Horizon” list, please add an About Us block
o	Content should be editable — we want to be able to update this text ourselves in the future


4.	Add a “Frequently Asked Questions” section
o	Directly below the About Us section, add a FAQ area
o	Please format it with expandable questions/answers if possible
o	Again, content should be easy for us to update
 
Buy a Ticket Page — Requested Modifications
1.	Game Management

o	We want to be able to:

	“Few Tickets Left” if below a certain threshold
	“No Tickets Available” if none are left


3.	Seat Map Enhancements

o	If possible, please implement a more realistic seat map, ideally one that resembles Vaudoise Arena in Lausanne

o	If a full map isn’t possible now, a better hockey arena-style layout would already be helpful


4.	Multiple Seat Selection

o	Users should be able to select multiple seats at once

o	The total price should automatically update based on selected seats

o	Show selected seat numbers, date, and location clearly below the map

6.	Additional Checkout Fields

o	Add input fields to collect:

	Home address

	Email address


o	These can be basic input fields and should appear before or with the "Purchase Ticket" button


Sell a Ticket – Requested Modifications
1.	Game Listing Order

o	Games should be listed in chronological order, with the soonest game at the top and the latest at the bottom

2.	 Expected Payout Text (Below the Total Amount)
o	The current sentence (“*Based on 75% of average resale price”) should be editable

3.	Bank Information Explanation

o	Please add a short paragraph above the bank input fields explaining why this information is needed

o	Text: “Why we ask for your bank details:”
“We use your bank information to process your payout after your ticket is resold. You retain full ownership of your ticket until it is purchased. Payments are transferred securely within 3–5 business days after the game.”


4.	Data Security Statement

o	Add a small text (below or near the payment fields) that reassures the user about how their data is handled. Suggested text:

o	“Your data is safe with us
Seatwell treats your personal and financial information with the highest level of security. Your data is encrypted and will never be shared with third parties.”
